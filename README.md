## Requirements :

- Python 3 installed on your computer
- The `pyserial` module installed (you can install it using pip: `pip install pyserial`)
- A SIM800C module connected to a USB port on your computer

<sub>Make sure the SIM800C module is properly connected and configured before running the script. Also, ensure that the correct serial port used for the SIM800C module is set in the script.</sub>


## Usage :

1. Download the repository to your computer by entering the following command in a command prompt or terminal window:

       git clone https://github.com/uruzFR/module-sim800c.git

2. Navigate to the directory where the Python script is saved.
3. Connect the SIM800C module to a USB port on your computer.
4. Open the Python script in a text editor and modify any necessary information (e.g. PIN code, phone number).
5. In the command prompt or terminal window, enter the following command to run the Python script: 

       python configure_sim800c.py

   (Make sure to replace "configure_sim800c.py" with the name of your actual script if it's different.)
6. Follow the prompts in the script to configure the SIM800C module.

Note: Before running the script, be sure to modify it with the appropriate information for your SIM800C module. This may include modifying the PIN code or phone number. Failure to do so may result in the module being configured incorrectly.``` 

This updated version includes instructions to download the repository using Git before continuing with the instructions to configure the SIM800C module using the Python script.
